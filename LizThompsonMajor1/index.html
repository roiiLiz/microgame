        <h2>About Breakcore</h2>
        <!--Quick explanation-->
        <p><strong>Breakcore</strong> is a style of electronic music with a focus on drum breaks and lots of sampling of audio, typically at high tempo. Breakcore has its roots in the late 1990s in places around the world, specifically the US and parts of western Europe (Italy, Britain, France). It has since then evolved into being decenteralized through the internet, which is reflected in the fact that many breakcore artists are from around the world. The music is typically described as chaotic, seemingly unstructured and only meant to produce noise.</p>

        <h2>On Breakcore Culture</h2>
        <p>Modern day breakcore culture is an encapsulation of the internet: many of the samples found in breakcore are of video games, anime, and other facets of internet culture such as popular memes. Much like the internet, breakcore is a bit of everything all at once, a good example being Venetian Snares' <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FbJ63spk48s">Hajnal.</a> The song is a mix of radically different styles meshed together to create something entirely new. It is stylistically similar, yet at the same time, completely different to other breakcore artists, much like how the internet has created communities which are similar yet different.</p>
        <p>Breakcore provides itself as an audio representation of the modern day internet. With the creation of social media, humans are constantly bombarded with visual and information noise, which is replicated in the seemingly chaotic and messy breaks in breakcore. The diversity in styles and sampling between artists only further proves this point, as everything from the most ancient of classical culture to the most experimental of modern culture has a place. Furthermore, each of the artists in the section above are all from different parts of the world, being Australia, Finland, and Canada respectively. Overall, breakcore's diversity serves as one of it's greatest strengths not just as a genre, but as art in general.</p>

        <h2>Influences</h2>
        <p>Breakcore is most directly influenced by and is a subgenre of <em>drum and bass</em>, which in and of itself is influnced by styles of EDM like <em>jungle</em>. Early breakcore can be traced to parts of western Europe and Australia in the late 90s, such as producers <strong>Aphasic</strong> of London and <strong>Bloody Fist Records</strong> of Australia. Also worth noting is that in 1994, <strong>Digital Hardcore Recordings</strong> published music of the <em>digital hardcore</em> genre, one which is similar to breakcore (similar high tempo & sampling).</p>
        <p>Currently, breakcore's legacy is difficult to talk about due to the nature of the genre itself. That is to say, the heavy sampling or mixing of genres makes it hard to define what exactly is or isn't breakcore. However, under a broad enough umbrella, breakcore has become an established subgenre of EDM, while also sporting subgenres of it's own (examples include speedcore for those who like audio garbage and breakcorpse for those who want to lose their hearing).</p>
